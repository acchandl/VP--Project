# Virtual Pet


This Virtual Pet is named Fluffy Bunny. Fluffy Bunny needs to be fed, exercised, and played with each day.
The longer you play with Fluffy Bunny, the happier she gets!

Fluffy Bunny is controlled by her hunger, exercise health, playfulness, and happiness (which is only
controlled with the Tick() method). The more you play with Fluffy Bunny, the more her Tick() gets initialized.

Have fun!
